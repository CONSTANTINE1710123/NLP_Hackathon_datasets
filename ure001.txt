URE001
Only students having a CGPA of 8.50 and above and who can take extra work load, will be 
qualified for this award. The student shall involve in research and development project during 
his/her 2nd or 3rd year of programme, under the guidance of a faculty-member for a period of 
five to six months. It would be including the summer or winter vacation periods. The student 
works with the faculty- member with the prior approval of the Dean of the programme School 
and carries out manual registration of URE001. At the end of the work, if the faculty is satisfied 
with the quality and quantum of work carried out by the student, the faculty guide may 
constitute an Evaluation Committee under the Dean of the programme School to recommend 
the award of URE001 to the student. Then such an award will be recorded in the Grade Sheet in 
the semester immediately following the semester, in which the work was carried out. However, 
there will be no credits or grade points assigned to URE001 and listed in the Grade Sheet with a 
short title of the work carried out and awarded ‘P’ grade. This can be availed, only once by a 
student for the entire duration of the programme. If the evaluation committee is not satisfied 
with the work, then, no entry will be made in the Grade Sheet and it will be presumed that the 
Registration made for URE001 stands cancelled.
