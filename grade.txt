Grade Improvement 
Students who wish to improve their grades will be permitted to register the same course again
during a subsequent Course Registration process. This course will be treated as another
course taken by the student and no relaxation in the maximum number of credits a student
can register during a semester, as indicated in Section 7.3. However, the student has to pay
the course fee for registering the course again. Such an option can be availed only once for a
given course and only one course can be registered for course improvement per semester. 
Students at their graduating year or timed out students are permitted to register more than
one ‘Grade Improvement’ courses, in order to improve their CGPA, which may help them
later during their placement process. Such a course should be indicated as ‘Grade
Improvement’ course during the Course Registration. The Grade improvement option is available 
only during regular semesters.
