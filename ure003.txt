URE003
Students who meet all their course and credit requirements as specified in their curriculum
will have less credit load when they reach their 7th semester (only Student Project may be left
to be completed). Such students, still maintaining a CGPA of 9.00 and above, may opt to
work in an existing research project available in the University which is related to his/her
programme of specialization in lieu of his/her Student Project. The research work should be
carried out for a minimum period of one year with adequate innovativeness. This research
oriented project work is expected to result in a high quality journal publication. Such Student
Projects will be evaluated by a separate evaluation committee constituted in line with the
M.Tech. Student Project Evaluation Committee.
Bearing in mind the quantum and quality of work put-in by the student, project work may
be recommended for URE003 award. URE003 carries six credits (apart the ‘capstone credit’
for the regular Student Project getting an ‘S’ grade) and an ‘S’ grade. This will be indicated
separately in the Grade Sheet of the student with a short title. Financial support if any for
URE003 may be made available by the concerned faculty members offering the project,
through their research funds, subject to the availability and provision of the work carried out.
The concerned learner would be having the benefit of an improved CGPA, given that six credits
are awarded with an ‘S’ grade. Of course, prior manual registration with the approval
of Dean of the programme School is necessary. If the Committee is not satisfied with the
research project work carried out by the student, then, the project shall be graded like any
other regular B.Tech. Student Project work for capstone credit, and suitable performance
grade may be awarded accordingly. No entry will be made in the Grade Sheet about
URE003 and it will be presumed that the Registration made for URE003 stands cancelled.
