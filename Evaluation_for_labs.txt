Evaluation for Laboratory courses / Component and Project Course / Component 
A few skill based courses may have only laboratory/ project component without a theory and/
or tutorial component. To make students attend lab classes without fail and to increase the
importance given to the lab classes, the practical component will be evaluated based on the
performance of the students in each experiment. Students who do not earn a minimum of
50% marks (sum of the marks awarded for all the assessments of the course) are declared
as ‘Fail’ in the lab course/component with an ‘N’ grade and they have to re-register the lab only
course/or lab component of a course. As in the case of Theory courses, laboratory courses will 
also have a Final Assessment Test. The weightage for the internal assessment will be 60% and 
for the Final Assessment will be 40%.
The project component will be assessed separately by the faculty by conducting a minimum
of three periodic reviews. These three periodic reviews would be conducted (1) before CAT I, 
(2) between CAT I and CAT II, (3) between CAT II and FAT. The ratio of the marks assessments 
for these reviews will be 20:30:50. No CAT/FAT will be conducted for the project components. 
For the Project course/component, the students who do not earn a minimum 50% marks
(sum of three reviews with 20:30:50 distribution) are declared as ‘Fail’ in the project
component /course, and consequently will be bracketed under ‘not completed’ course, and
hence an “N” grade will be awarded. The total marks of the course shall be calculated based
on the ratio between the theory (including tutorials), laboratory and the project credits i.e. 
(L+T :( P/2) :( J/4))
