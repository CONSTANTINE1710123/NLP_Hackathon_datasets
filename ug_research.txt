UG Research Experience
To provide an opportunity to students who are ambitious in pursuing a career in research or 
academics, an Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) award is constituted. URE has four 
components, coded as URE001, URE002, URE003 and URE004. They are independent of
each other. As of now URE is applicable to B.Tech. programmes only.
