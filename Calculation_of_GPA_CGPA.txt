Calculation of GPA and CGPA
The Grade Point Average (GPA) earned by a student is a quantitative indication of his/her
performance in a semester. GPA is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in
all the courses registered (after add/drop/ withdrawal) by the student during the semester.
For each course registered, the grade points earned is multiplied by the credits for that
course. The sum of all such grade point-credits product is divided by the total credits registered
in that semester to get the GPA of that semester.

The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), which indicates the overall performance of a
student from the time he/she joined the University to a specific semester, is obtained by
calculating the weighted average of the grade points, obtained in all the courses registered
by the student since the first semester. Both GPA and CGPA are calculated as follows at
the end of every semester and indicated in the Grade Sheet. 
𝐶𝐺𝑃𝐴 = ∑𝑖(𝐶𝑖 ∗ 𝐺𝑃)
∑𝑖 𝐶𝑖
Where, Ci is the number of credits for the course, and GP is the grade points earned for that 
course. i includes all the courses registered in all semesters including those in which the student 
has an ‘F’ grade. If a student had failed more than once in a course or substituted a course, the 
credits will appear only once, both in the numerator and denominator. Pass-Fail (‘P’ grade), audit 
courses and courses taken towards ‘Minor’ or ‘Honours’ are not counted for the calculation of 
GPA or CGPA of the programme. The Consolidated Grade Sheet or Degree Certificate will not 
mention any ‘class’ or whatsoever, except the CGPA and ‘Honours’. GPA/ CGPA will be indicated 
by rounding-up the actual values to two decimal places.
% equivalent of CGPA = CGPA * 10
For example, a CGPA of 8.75 is considered equivalent to 87.5% (CGPA pf 8.75 x 10 = 87.5%)
Controller of Examinations will issue obligatory-certificates to students, who request for CGPA to 
percentage equivalence of marks.
