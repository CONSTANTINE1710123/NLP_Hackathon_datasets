Academic Malpractice
Academic malpractice shall be viewed very seriously and penalized appropriately. In order to
discourage students from indulging in such activities, each case shall be enquired by a
‘Malpractice Committee’, constituted by the University and suitable punishment will be given,
if the malpractice is proven. If a student indulges in malpractice, in any component of the
24
Continuous Assessments (like CATs), zero marks will be assigned in all subjects registered in
that semester, for the corresponding examination. If a student indulges in malpractice in the
FAT, all the regular courses in which the student was eligible to write and attended the FAT of
that semester, for which he/she registered and attended shall be awarded ‘N’ grade, as a
retribution. However, the students will be permitted to clear those courses in subsequent
semesters (as and when it is offered) by re-registration.
