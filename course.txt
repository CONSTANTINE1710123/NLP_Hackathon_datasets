Course Substitution
If a student receives an ‘F’ grade in a PE course, and if the student wishes, he/she is
permitted to take another PE course from the same basket, in lieu of PE course, the student
had failed to clear, in subsequent semesters and clear the new PE course. However, the
student has to pay for the substituted course since the student has utilized the opportunity
of clearing a course in first attempt.
If a student receives an ‘F’ grade in a UE course, and if the student wishes, he/she is
permitted to take another UE course instead of the UE course the student had failed to
qualify, in subsequent semesters and clear the new course. Further, the student is also
permitted to choose a PE course from his/her curriculum, instead of the UE course that the
student had failed to clear. However, the student has to pay for the substituted course, since the
student has utilized the opportunity of clearing a course in the very first attempt. Such course
substitution option can be exercised only once, either for a PE or UE, for entire duration of the
programme. Course Substitution is not applicable for UC or PC courses
