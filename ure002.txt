URE002 
As indicated in Section 6.4.5, a student undertakes the Student Project work under the
guidance of a faculty-member, similar to any other student project. However, URE002 is
awarded to truly exceptional quality and quantum of research work carried out by an individual
student in lieu of his/her Student Project. If the Student Project Evaluation Committee
finds that the student has carried out a project work which is substantially advanced 
than what is normally expected from a B.Tech. student, then, the project work may be referred
to a high-profile Committee. It would be constituted under the Dean of the programme
School, with at least one external expert, preferably from a reputed Institution like IIT or IISc, 
Bengaluru. If this Committee certifies that the work carried out by the student is exceptional
in extent and quality, then, the project shall be recommended for URE002 award. URE002
carries four credits (apart from the 20 credits for the regular Student Project getting an ‘S’
grade) and an ‘S’ grade point. This will be separately indicated in the Grade Sheet of the
student with a short title of the work carried out. The advantage to the student will be
that his/her CGPA will increase, given that four credits are awarded with an ‘S’ grade. No
prior registration is needed for URE002 award.
